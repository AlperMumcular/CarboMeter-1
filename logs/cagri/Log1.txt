    My name is Mustafa Çağrı Durgut and this is my weekly log of our CS102 project "CarboPoint" This week i started to build our application's storage. I choose the option of using local database to store information. And for that i use sqlite. I create a class called DatabaseConnection and defined necessary methods for my friends to use. I created a table called users and provided static methods in it. Then i checked my class with a main class to be sure that database works correctly. I can say that our storage is nearly done however, according to my friends needs i may add new columns to the table.
